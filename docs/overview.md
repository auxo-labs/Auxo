# Auxo Architecture & System Overview

Auxo is a zero-auth, collaborative prompt engineering workspace built with Next.js 16 (App Router) and Tailwind CSS v4. It parses unstructured brainstorming notes into structured, prompt-optimized context files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `.cursor/rules/`) for 2026 AI coding agents.

## 2. Core Functional Pillars

*   **Premium Obsidian Design:** Built with high-contrast serif typography (`Playfair_Display`) and grid patterns (`dot-bg`), inspired by Aceternity and Refero Design.
*   **Real-time Collaboration & Sync:** Syncs markdown keystrokes and builder presence in real-time using **Supabase Broadcast & Presence**, maintaining an ephemeral collaborative canvas.
*   **Software 3.0 Context Matrix:** Processes raw notes into a multi-file matrix designed to keep agent context windows highly scoped, preventing "lost-in-the-middle" attention degradation.
*   **Client-Side ZIP Bundling:** Uses `JSZip` to compile the generated context structure and initiate downloads of the exact file structure required by Cursor and Claude Code.
*   **Hybrid Cloud & Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) Tiers:** Deep compilations can run via our hosted cloud infrastructure (gated by Supabase Auth and Stripe credit packs or a Lifetime Access Pass in GBP) or completely for free via BYOK. BYOK keys for Google Gemini, Anthropic, or OpenAI are stored strictly in client-side `localStorage` and bypass all authentication and payment checks.
*   **LocalStorage Crash Safety:** Scratchpad content is continuously mirrored to `localStorage` by Room UUID, restoring the user's work automatically on refresh or accidental tab close.
*   **Context Optimality Specs:** An interactive technical whitepaper hosted at `/optimality` detailing compiler scope boundaries, token efficiencies, and attention maps.

## 3. LLM Architecture & Rate Limiting Strategy

Auxo orchestrates calls to advanced LLMs (OpenAI's `gpt-4o-mini`, Anthropic's `claude-3-5-sonnet`, or Google's `gemini-2.5-flash`) to parse unstructured developer notes into structured prompt configurations. To ensure reliability, speed, and cost efficiency, the following strategies are implemented:

*   **Multi-Tier Fallback & BYOK Engine:**
    1. For hosted premium runs, if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is configured, it defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`. If missing/failed, it falls back to `claude-3-5-sonnet` (if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured). Local offline builds fall back to `localMockCompile`.
    2. For BYOK configurations, requests are routed directly to the client-provided key and model (e.g. Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.7/4.5, GPT-4o), bypassing hosted database accounting.
*   **Token-Gating as a Rate-Limiter:** For hosted cloud runs, requiring accounts and decrementing credit balances prevents endpoint abuse. For BYOK runs, API usage costs are borne directly by the developer's own API subscription.
*   **Keyless Registry Caching:** The live `tech-resolver.ts` queries NPM Registry metadata via `fetch` using Next.js route caching (`next: { revalidate: 3600 }`). This caches NPM requests for 1 hour, protecting the registry API from rate-limiting penalties while keeping stack resolutions live.
*   **Client-Side Throttling:** The compilation actions inside the room UI disable the triggers (`isCompiling` state) and block concurrent compilations during an active request.
